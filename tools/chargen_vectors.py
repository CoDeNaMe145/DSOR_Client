"""Character creation fixtures from the server's codec (crates/proto/tests/chargen_release261.rs).

Usage: python tools/chargen_vectors.py <server> <output-directory>

CharacterGenerationCommand both ways, written by the server's own
encode_character_generation: the editor the server opens (operation 2), a
refusal (4) and a creation (5), and the client's requests for the editor (1)
and for a new character (3), checked by its decoder. Only pure protocol modules
are imported; no player database is opened.
